This Android application is designed to give easy access to the public water access site location information provided by the MN DNR on their Data Deli website.  The only modifications made to the DNR data is to convert from UTM to latitude/longitude which is easier to use with the Android APIs.  The location data is not guarenteed to be accurate, in fact there are many instances where it is known to be inaccurate.  Any issues with the accuracy of the data should be presented to the MN DNR.
